							<h1>Hi, I'm Susan</h1>
							<p class="major">I am a second-year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center, advised by Professor <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~golrezae/">Negin Golrezaei</a>. I am interested in learning theory, machine learning, and optimization algorithms with applications to revenue management, assortment planning, and various other problems in Operations Management. In general, I love applying mathematical tools to solve complex real-world problems. I also love building things from scratch. Previously, I graduated from MIT with an SB in mathematics and computer science in June 2018.</p>

									<h3>What Do Neural Machine Transaltion Model Infers About Multiple Semantics of Homonyms?</h3>
									<p>Working with the Spoken Language System group at MIT CSAIL, we investigated how well a neural machine translation model infers multiple senses from homonyms. We empirically evaluated the quality of NMT representations for learning the different meanings of homonyms through an extrinsic meaning classification task, by conducting a thorough investigation for both unidirectional and bidirectional NMT models trained with various target languages. We analyzed how various target languages used in training NMT models affect how well NMT representations convey the different meanings of homonyms. This is a necessary first step to incorporate the best meaning disambiguation system to the models, which would improve the NMT model’s ability to translate sentences containing homonyms.</p>

									<h3>Finding the Bad Apples in the Bunch: Using Robust Optimization to Optimally Structure A Cancer Fund</h3>
									<p>We utilize robust optimization to optimally structure a cancer megafund that invests in a large number of drug development projects at various stages to substantially reduce the portfolio’s risk. Here, project selection is a crucial aspect in constructing a portfolio which maximizes the return over risk ratio, as we want to allocate capital to high-potential opportunities and avoid the non-performing ones. To determine which projects are worth investing in, we use robust optimization methods to consider the space of all possible subsets of projects, and from those, we identify the worst possible subset, i.e., the bad apples in the bunch.</p>

									<h3>SCRAM: Securely Measuring Cyber Risk</h3>
									<p>Working with the Lab of Financial Engineering and Internet Policy Research Initative groups at MIT, we present a solution to cybersecurity challenge by creating a new cryptographic platform that allows multiple firms to compute aggregate measures of cyber risk without requiring any firm to disclose their own sensitive data on cyber attacks, penetrations, and losses.</p>

								<section>
									<h3>Spoofing Alert Platform</h3>
									<p>With my collaborators, we create an alert platform to detect spoofing in securities market and alert traders when their actions appear like spoofing.</p>

									<span class="icon brands style2 major fa-twitter"></span>
									<p>In Summer 2016, I was a Software Developer at the Home Onboarding Team in Twitter. I conducted and built feature experiments on "who to follow" modules for new and resurrected users. I also created web re-onboarding feature, a flow to refine social graph of resurrected users.</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-hotel"></span>
									<p>I worked with the early machine learning team at Traveloka, a leading Southeast Asia online travel company, to create a recommender system for hotels using various statistics and machine learning approach, and test them empirically.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<p>I spent two summers at Goldman Sachs on several trading floor teams, including FX Systematic Market Making, Quantitative Options, and Structured Product desks.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<p>I generate answers for a forum on SehatQ, an online health platform in Indonesia, using transfer learning (in question retrieval tasks) from MayoClinic questions and answers.</p>
